This directory attempts to do MPI on marching cubes using the following
steps:

get the VTK file,  divide up it up and do MPI, convert each piece to mhd, apply marching cubes to each process, output the resulting vtk data, and then conglomerate the files into 1 vtk file.

To convert vtk file to an mhd file (referencing a zraw file), we would go 
to the PolyDataToImageData/build directory, add in the vtk file, and then
do the command

sudo mpirun -np 9 ./PolyDataToImageData

In this case, with 9, there are 8 child processes and 1 master process

This produces an mhd file and a zraw file in the Serial_Test directory.

Then, you can render output the vtk files by doing:

sudo mpirun -np 9 python MeshLabelImageColor.py BroccoliBeef.vtk
